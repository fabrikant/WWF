Weather forecast requires API key and found location
Generate API key on openweathermap.org and paste it in the settings. It is more convenient to use Garmin Connect, but you can use a watch.
Start a GPS workout to capture the location. After the location is determined, start the watch face.

The watchface has many features. I'm too lazy to list them. Anyone who is interested will understand itself.
